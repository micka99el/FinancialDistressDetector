# Bankruptcy Event Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify bankruptcy events within financial datasets. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify clients as either bankrupt or non-bankrupt based on their financial attributes and indicators.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical financial data for various credit applicants, including features such as vintage year, monthly installment, loan balance, and bureau score. The dataset is available in the file `Default_Data.csv`.

## Methodology
The project follows the following methodology:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploring the relationships between different financial indicators and bankruptcy status, identifying patterns, and visualizing distributions.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the model's performance.
4. Model Building: Developing machine learning models, such as logistic regression, random forest, and SVM, to predict bankruptcy events.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
